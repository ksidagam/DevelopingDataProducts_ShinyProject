### Performance Rate of Equipments in Manufacturing Plants
The App which i devolped would be usefull in calculating the Performance Rate of Equipments .This would be more helpful to Plant Operators.

As in the Manufacturing plants operators needs to know the performance of the machine.

Based on the Peformance only they can estimate the life time of the Equipement and do the preventive maintenance like replacement or repair.


## Inputs and Outputs



```{r, echo=FALSE}
shinyUI(pageWithSidebar( 
  headerPanel("Equipment Performance Calculation"), 
  sidebarPanel(
    h3("Calculation Inputs"),
    p('Actual Throughput'),
    p('Optimum Throughput'),
    br(),
    h3("Calculation Outputs"),
    p('Equipment Performance'),
    p('Equipment Performance Rate (%)')),
  
  mainPanel(
    h3("Summary"),
    p("This App should be useful to find the Performance rate of the Equipment in Manufacturing Plant"),
    br(),
    p("For Example let us take an example of Manufacturing Plant,"),
    p("Plant Operator what to find's out what is the  Performance rate of the Equipment in Manufacturing Plant "),
    p("The performance rate is derived from production data. Performance rate compares the speed at which the unit was operated to the rated design speed."),
    br(),
    
    strong("Actual Throughput (or) Equipment Operating Time = Equipment Loading Time - Equipment Unplanned Downtime"),
    br(),
    br(),
    strong("Optimum Throughput (or) Equipment Net Operating Time = Equipment Operating Time - Equipment Total Speed Loss"),
    br(),
    br(),
    strong("Performance Rate = Actual Throughput/Optimum Throughput *100"),
    br()
    )))
```
